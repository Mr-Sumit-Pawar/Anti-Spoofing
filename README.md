# 🛡️ Anti-Spoofing Face Detection

This project is a **deep learning-based face anti-spoofing model** that distinguishes between real and fake (spoofed) faces using image input. It helps prevent face spoofing attacks in systems like biometric authentication, surveillance, and secure access control.
